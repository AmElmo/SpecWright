# Configure review preferences

**Issue ID**: ENG-005  
**Status**: pending  
**Category**: fullstack  
**Complexity Score**: 4/10  
**Estimated Hours**: 3h  
**Complexity Reasoning**: Standard CRUD settings page with toggle UI - familiar pattern but needs database schema.

## Description

Let users customize which categories of issues to check. Preferences are saved to their profile and applied to all future reviews.

## Technical Details

- Settings page with toggle switches for each category
- GET/PUT `/api/users/review-preferences` endpoints
- Database table `review_preferences` with user_id foreign key
- Backend filters AI prompts based on enabled categories (saves tokens)

## Dependencies

- User authentication system (to associate preferences with user)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Settings page shows four category toggles
- [ ] Toggles reflect current saved preferences
- [ ] Changes save automatically (or with Save button)
- [ ] Toast confirms "Preferences saved"
- [ ] New reviews respect the preferences
- [ ] Disabled categories not sent to AI (saves tokens)
- [ ] Default: Security, Bugs, Performance ON; Style OFF

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- API test: Preferences saved and retrieved correctly
- Unit test: Toggle state reflects saved preferences
- Integration test: Review filters based on preferences

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Navigate to Settings → Code Review
2. Turn off "Style" suggestions and save
3. Run a new code review on code with style issues
4. Verify no style suggestions appear
