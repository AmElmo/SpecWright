# View review history

**Issue ID**: ENG-006  
**Status**: pending  
**Category**: fullstack  
**Complexity Score**: 4/10  
**Estimated Hours**: 3h  
**Complexity Reasoning**: Standard list/detail pattern with pagination - well-established patterns to follow.

## Description

Build a history page showing past code reviews. Users can see what was analyzed, how many issues were found, and re-open previous reviews.

## Technical Details

- History table component with sortable columns
- GET `/api/code-reviews` endpoint with pagination and user filter
- Re-open review in read-only mode (no editing, just viewing)
- Query optimized with indexes on user_id and created_at

## Dependencies

- ENG-001 (code submission) - need reviews to exist in history

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] History shows reviews from last 30 days
- [ ] Table columns: Date, Language, Issues, Fixed, Actions
- [ ] Sorted by date descending (newest first)
- [ ] "View" button opens the review
- [ ] Past review shows in read-only mode
- [ ] Applied/dismissed states preserved
- [ ] Empty state for users with no history
- [ ] Pagination if >20 reviews

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- API test: Pagination returns correct page size
- API test: Results filtered by current user only
- Unit test: Empty state renders when no reviews

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Navigate to Code Review → History tab
2. Verify past reviews are listed with correct data
3. Click "View" on a past review
4. Verify it opens in read-only mode with original suggestions
