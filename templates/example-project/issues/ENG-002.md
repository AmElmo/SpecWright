# View and explore suggestions

**Issue ID**: ENG-002  
**Status**: approved  
**Category**: frontend  
**Complexity Score**: 5/10  
**Estimated Hours**: 4h  
**Complexity Reasoning**: UI component work with filtering and editor integration - standard patterns but attention to detail needed for UX.

## Description

Build the suggestions panel where developers can browse, filter, and understand the issues found in their code. Clicking a suggestion highlights the relevant line in the editor.

## Technical Details

- Suggestion list component with category filtering tabs
- Card expand/collapse with smooth animation
- Editor line highlighting integration via Monaco API
- Severity badges with color coding (Critical=red, Warning=yellow, Info=blue)

## Dependencies

- ENG-001 (code submission) must be complete to have suggestions to display

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Category tabs show counts per category
- [ ] Clicking tab filters suggestion list
- [ ] Each suggestion shows severity badge with color
- [ ] Clicking suggestion scrolls editor to that line
- [ ] Line is highlighted in editor (yellow background)
- [ ] Expanded card shows full AI explanation
- [ ] Empty state shows celebration when no issues found
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (arrow keys, Enter)

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Unit test: Filter logic returns correct suggestions
- Unit test: Severity badge renders correct color
- Component test: Expand/collapse animation completes

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Submit code with issues in multiple categories
2. Click each category tab and verify filtering
3. Click a suggestion and verify editor scrolls to correct line
4. Verify keyboard navigation through the list
