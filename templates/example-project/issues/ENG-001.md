# Submit code for AI review

**Issue ID**: ENG-001  
**Status**: approved  
**Category**: fullstack  
**Complexity Score**: 6/10  
**Estimated Hours**: 5h  
**Complexity Reasoning**: Requires Monaco editor integration, API endpoint, and Claude AI integration - multiple moving parts but well-documented patterns.

## Description

Implement the complete flow for submitting code and receiving AI-powered suggestions. User pastes code into the editor, clicks analyze, and sees results within seconds.

## Technical Details

- Monaco editor integration with JavaScript/TypeScript syntax highlighting
- POST `/api/code-reviews` endpoint that accepts code and returns suggestions
- Claude API integration with code analysis prompt
- Store reviews in `code_reviews` table with 30-day retention

## Dependencies

- Claude API key configured in environment
- Database migrations for `code_reviews` table

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monaco editor renders with JS/TS syntax highlighting
- [ ] Language auto-detected from code content
- [ ] "Analyze Code" button triggers API call
- [ ] Loading skeleton shows during analysis
- [ ] Suggestions displayed grouped by category
- [ ] Error state with retry if API fails
- [ ] Review saved for history (30-day retention)

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Unit test: Code submission validation
- Integration test: API endpoint returns valid suggestion structure
- E2E test: Full flow from paste to suggestions displayed

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Paste JavaScript code with obvious issues (unused variable, console.log)
2. Click "Analyze Code" 
3. Verify suggestions appear within 10 seconds
4. Verify each suggestion has category, severity, and description
