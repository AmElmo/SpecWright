## Description

Configure Google Cloud Console project, create OAuth 2.0 credentials, and set up authorized redirect URIs for the application. This is the foundational step required before implementing any OAuth flows.

## Technical Details

1. Create or use existing Google Cloud Platform project
2. Enable Google+ API and Google Identity services
3. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
4. Configure authorized JavaScript origins (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
5. Configure authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`)
6. Store Client ID and Client Secret securely in environment variables

## Dependencies

None - This is the first task that must be completed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google Cloud Platform project created/configured
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 credentials generated
- [ ] Client ID and Client Secret stored in `.env` file
- [ ] Redirect URIs properly configured for development and production
- [ ] Credentials verified to work with test authentication flow

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Unit test to verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- Integration test to verify credentials format is valid

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Log into Google Cloud Console
2. Verify OAuth consent screen is configured
3. Verify authorized redirect URIs match application URLs
4. Test that Client ID can be used to initiate OAuth flow

## Subtasks

1. Create Google Cloud Platform account (if needed)
2. Create new project or select existing one
3. Enable required APIs
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Download credentials and add to environment variables
6. Test credentials with simple OAuth flow

**Notes**: Keep Client Secret secure and never commit to version control. Use separate credentials for development and production environments.
