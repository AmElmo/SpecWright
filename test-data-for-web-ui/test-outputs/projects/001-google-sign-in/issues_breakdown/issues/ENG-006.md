## Description

Implement AuthContext using React Context API to provide global authentication state across the application. Handle user login state, token storage, and user profile data.

## Technical Details

Create authentication context with:
- Current user state
- Loading state
- Login/logout methods
- Token management
- Automatic token refresh

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  login: (token: string) => void;
  logout: () => void;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

## Dependencies

None - This is frontend infrastructure that can be built independently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AuthContext created with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] AuthProvider wraps application
- [ ] useAuth hook created for consuming context
- [ ] User state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Token stored securely (httpOnly cookie or secure storage)
- [ ] Loading state prevents flicker during auth check
- [ ] Logout clears all auth data

## Test Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Context provides correct initial state
- Login updates user state
- Logout clears user state
- useAuth hook throws error outside provider
- Token persists across remounts

### Manual Verification (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. Wrap app with AuthProvider
2. Log in and verify state updates
3. Refresh page and verify state persists
4. Log out and verify state clears
5. Check multiple components can access auth state

## Subtasks

1. Create AuthContext interface
2. Implement AuthProvider component
3. Create useAuth custom hook
4. Add token storage logic
5. Implement auto token refresh
6. Add loading states
7. Test context throughout app

**Notes**: Consider using zustand or Redux if context becomes too complex. Ensure sensitive data isn't exposed in client state unnecessarily.
